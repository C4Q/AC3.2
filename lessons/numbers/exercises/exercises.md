//Numbers
//
//Question 1.
//
//What is true about Integers in computers?
// c

//Question 2.
//
//Explain why the maximum value of UInt8 is equals 255. Why is the maximum value of Int8 127?
//UInt8 and Int8 have the same amount placeholders put Int8 includes negative numbers while UInt8 is from 0 to 255.

//Question 3.
//
//Consider the constants below. Which code will compile?
//
//e. All will compile.

//Question 4.
//
//Evaluate the following: Given:
//
var a = 20
var b = 5
var c = 4

//Compute:
//
//1. 25
//2. 1
//3. 120
//4. 40
//5. 5
//6. 1
//    


//Question 5.
//
//What are the values of div and div2 below? Are they equal?
//
//let div = 11 / 3 = 3
//let div2 = 11.0 / 3.0 = 3.6666666667
//They are not equal.


//Question 6.
//
//Given var number = 7.5. What can be inferred about number?
//

//b. number is a double variable

//Question 7.
//
//Without using Playground, will the below code print?
//
//let twelve: Double = 12.0
//let thirteen: Float = 13.0
//
//print(twelve + thirteen)
//It will not print.




//Question 8.
//
//Write the following numbers in binary representation:
//
//a. 25
//11001
//b. 100
//1100100
//c. 65
//1000001
//d. 255
//11111111
//Question 8.
//
//Which of the following numbers can't be assigned to an Int8, and why?:
//
//a. 25
//b. 100
//c. 65
//d. 255
//Only 255 can't.

//Question 9.
//
//What integer types could you use for the offending value in Question 8 that would not produce an error?:
//Int16, Int32, Int64, UInt8, UInt32, and UInt64
//
.//Question 10.
//
//What are the differences between Double and Int in the numbers they can represent and how they store them?
//
//Question 11.
//
//What are the differences between Float and Double?
//
//Question 12.
//
//What will the following code do?:
//
//var width: Double = 48.8
//var extraWidth: Float = 10.5
//
//let totalWidth = width + extraWidth
//Question 13.
//
//Alter the code in Question 12 to do what we want it to.

#### Question 1.
What is true about __Integers__ in computers?
```
a. Integers must have a positive or negative sign always.
b. The maximum value for Integers is +âˆž.
c. Integer types in computers take up a fixed amount of memory.
d. Integers may contain decimals.
```

#### Question 2.
Explain why the maximum value of ```UInt8``` is equals 255. Why is the maximum value of ```Int8``` 127?

#### Question 3.
Consider the constants below. Which code will compile?
```
a. let numberOfPages: Int = 500
b. let numberOfChapters = "For Whom The Bell Tolls"
c. let nameOfBook: Int = 14
d. let yearPublished = "Nineteen-thirty-five"
e. All will compile.
```

#### Question 4.
Evaluate the following:
Given:
```
var a = 20
var b = 5
var c = 4
```
Compute:
```
1. a += b
2. b -= c
3. b * (c + a)
4. (b * c) + a
5. b %= a
6. b %= c
```

#### Question 5.
What are the values of ```div``` and ```div2``` below? Are they equal?
```
let div = 11 / 3
let div2 = 11.0 / 3.0
```

#### Question 6.
Given ```var number = 7.5```. What can be inferred about __number__?
```
a. number is a float variable
b. number is a double variable
c. number is a 32-bit floating point number
d. not enough information to infer about number's type
```

#### Question 7.
Without using Playground, will the below code print?
```
let twelve: Double = 12.0
let thirteen: Float = 13.0

print(twelve + thirteen)
```

#### Question 8.
Write the following numbers in binary representation:
```
a. 25
b. 100
c. 65
d. 255
```

#### Question 8.
Which of the following numbers can't be assigned to an Int8, and why?:
```
a. 25
b. 100
c. 65
d. 255
```

#### Question 9.

What integer types could you use for the offending value in Question 8 that would not produce an error?:

#### Question 10.

What are the differences between ```Double``` and ```Int``` in the numbers they can represent and how they store them?

#### Question 11.

What are the differences between ```Float``` and ```Double```?

#### Question 12.

What will the following code do?:

```swift
