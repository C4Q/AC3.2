## Numbers

#### Question 1.
What is true about __Integers__ in computers?
```c. Integer types in computers take up a fixed amount of memory.
```

#### Question 2.
Explain why the maximum value of ```UInt8``` is equals 255. Why is the maximum value of ```Int8``` 127?

In the UInt8 there are no negative numbers with in the range and only 256 spots in total so the maximum value is 255 because UInt includes 0. In the Int8 still has 256 values but includes negative numbers

#### Question 3.
Consider the constants below. Which code will compile?
```

e. All will compile.
```

#### Question 4.
Evaluate the following:
Given:
```
var a = 20
var b = 5
var c = 4
```
Compute:
```
1. a += b  >>>> 25
2. b -= c >>> 1
3. b * (c + a)  >>> 120
4. (b * c) + a  >>> 40
5. b %= a  >>> 5 
6. b %= c  >>> 1
```

#### Question 5.
What are the values of ```div``` and ```div2``` below? Are they equal?
```
let div = 11 / 3 >>> 3
let div2 = 11.0 / 3.0 >>> 3.67 

two different types one is two intergers being divided so you will get an integer as an answer the later are two doubles so it will produce a double 
```

#### Question 6.
Given ```var number = 7.5```. What can be inferred about __number__?
```

b. number is a double variable
```

#### Question 7.
Without using Playground, will the below code print?
```
let twelve: Double = 12.0
let thirteen: Float = 13.0

print(twelve + thirteen)
```
no it will not print tow different types 


#### Question 8.
Write the following numbers in binary representation:
```
a. 25 >>>>
b. 100 >>>>
c. 65>>>
d. 255
```

#### Question 8.
Which of the following numbers can't be assigned to an Int8, and why?:
```
a. 25
b. 100
c. 65
d. 255
```

#### Question 9.

What integer types could you use for the offending value in Question 8 that would not produce an error?:

#### Question 10.

What are the differences between ```Double``` and ```Int``` in the numbers they can represent and how they store them?

#### Question 11.

What are the differences between ```Float``` and ```Double```?

#### Question 12.

What will the following code do?:

```swift
var width: Double = 48.8
var extraWidth: Float = 10.5

let totalWidth = width + extraWidth
```

#### Question 13.

Alter the code in Question 12 to do what we want it to.
