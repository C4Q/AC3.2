## Numbers Margaret Ikeda & Kareem James

#### Question 1.
What is true about __Integers__ in computers?
```
a. Integers must have a positive or negative sign always.
b. The maximum value for Integers is +âˆž.
c. Integer types in computers take up a fixed amount of memory.
d. Integers may contain decimals.
```
C

#### Question 2.
Explain why the maximum value of ```UInt8``` is equals 255. Why is the maximum value of ```Int8``` 127?
The maximum value of UInt8 is 255 because it contains only unsigned numbers and zero. Int8 includes positive and negative (signed) numbers so can only contain half as many.

#### Question 3.
Consider the constants below. Which code will compile?
```
a. let numberOfPages: Int = 500
b. let numberOfChapters = "For Whom The Bell Tolls"
c. let nameOfBook: Int = 14
d. let yearPublished = "Nineteen-thirty-five"
e. All will compile.
```
E

#### Question 4.
Evaluate the following:
Given:
```
var a = 20
var b = 5
var c = 4
```
Compute:
```
1. a += b 25
2. b -= c 1
3. b * (c + a) 120
4. (b * c) + a 40
5. b %= a 0
6. b %= c 1
```

#### Question 5.
What are the values of ```div``` and ```div2``` below? Are they equal?
```
let div = 11 / 3
let div2 = 11.0 / 3.0
```

#### Question 6.
Given ```var number = 7.5```. What can be inferred about __number__?
```
a. number is a float variable
b. number is a double variable
c. number is a 32-bit floating point number
d. not enough information to infer about number's type
B```

#### Question 7.
Without using Playground, will the below code print?
```
let twelve: Double = 12.0
let thirteen: Float = 13.0

print(twelve + thirteen)
```
NO

#### Question 8.
Write the following numbers in binary representation:
```
a. 25 
b. 100 
00000100
c. 65
d. 255
11111111
```

#### Question 8.
Which of the following numbers can't be assigned to an Int8, and why?:
```
a. 25
b. 100
c. 65
d. 255
```
D because the max of Int is 127 and 255 is larger.

#### Question 9.

What integer types could you use for the offending value in Question 8 that would not produce an error?:

Int16, Int32, Int64

#### Question 10.

What are the differences between ```Double``` and ```Int``` in the numbers they can represent and how they store them?

Doubles include decimals and store them as significand, exponent, and signed bit. Integer can represent whole numbers with no decimal and stores them in binary. 

#### Question 11.

What are the differences between ```Float``` and ```Double```?

Float is a 32-bit floating-point number. Double is a 64-bit floating-point number and is more accurate than Float.

#### Question 12.

What will the following code do?:

```swift
var width: Double = 48.8
var extraWidth: Float = 10.5

let totalWidth = width + extraWidth
```
ERROR
#### Question 13.

Alter the code in Question 12 to do what we want it to.

```swift
var width: Double = 48.8
var extraWidth: Double = 10.5

let totalWidth = width + extraWidth
```
