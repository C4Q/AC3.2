// 1. Create an array of strings called "myFavoriteMovies" with 5 values. Print.

// 2. Create a string variable called "numberOneMovie" and assign it the first item of your "myFavoriteMovies" array. Print.

// 3. Uncomment the array "cities" below. Notice that this is an array without any values so far. How can we add values to the array? Uncomment the next line. Insert any city inside the quotations. Repeat that line to add other strings into the array. After adding 5 more values into the "cities" array, print.

//var cities = [String]()
//cities.append("")

// 4. Create a string variable called "biggestCity" and assign it one of the values from your "cities" array.

// 5. Create an array of integers called "numbers" and leave it empty.

// 6. Add 5 integers to the array "numbers". Afterwards, try adding 3.14 - what happens?

// 7. Consider the below dictionary called "whiteHouse". What are the differences between an array and a dictionary?

var whiteHouse = [
    "name" : "The White House",
    "address" : "1600 Pennsylvania Ave",
    "numberOfRooms" : 100,
    "isPaintedWhite" : true
]

// List the keys and list their values. What types are they?

// 8. Uncomment the below line. Here we're adding to the dictionary, specifically the key "currentResident" which has the value "The Obama Family". Add at least two more sensible key/value pairs to the whiteHouse dictionary for example "numberOfStaff". Then print.

//whiteHouse["currentResident"] = "The Obama Family"

// 9. Print each key and value in the follow dictionary
let capitals = ["Israel": "Jerusalem",
                "France": "Paris",
                "England": "London"]


// 10. Create a dictionary the describes you. The dictionary should have key/value pair that holds your name, your age, your address, a Bool that says if you love pizza or not, and any other key/value you want. Print your dictionary.

// You're done! Move on to the next page.
