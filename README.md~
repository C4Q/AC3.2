Have a great weekend. To cut into that a bit 
I've prepared this [homework](/homework/week-2-playground). I do hope
it's at least a little fun.

This evening is your Meetup.

And tomorrow (Friday), we'll review and have an assessment and a short day (!). We're
aware of the tightness of this schedule and are preparing the assessment with it in mind.

Also don't forget to read up on [functions](/lessons/functions-one), the

Welcome back, and welcome to Hunters Point Plaza at 
47-40 21st St, Long Island City, NY 11101, top floor.

The reading is basically the same for [tomorrow](/lessons/functions-two), in terms
of what to read but we'll cover more of it and it'll probably mean more to you another
time around.
