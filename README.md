//Numbers
//
//Question 1.
//
//What is true about Integers in computers?

//a. Integers must have a positive or negative sign always.
//b. The maximum value for Integers is +âˆž.
//c. Integer types in computers take up a fixed amount of memory.
//d. Integers may contain decimals.
//
//a. false
//b. false
//c. true
//d.false

//Question 2.
//
//Explain why the maximum value of UInt8 is equals 255. Why is the maximum value of Int8 127?
//
//an 8 byte memory can only hold 8 values of the power of two
//
//unsigned will only represent positive values and that goes up to 255
//
//and signed will represent an equal number of positive and negative values (where it factors 0 as a positive value)


//Question 3.
//
//Consider the constants below. Which code will compile?
//
//a. let numberOfPages: Int = 500
//b. let numberOfChapters = "For Whom The Bell Tolls"
//c. let nameOfBook: Int = 14
//d. let yearPublished = "Nineteen-thirty-five"
//e. All will compile.
//
//e

//Question 4.
//
//Evaluate the following: Given:
//
//var a = 20
//var b = 5
//var c = 4
//Compute:
//
//1. a += b = 25
//2. b -= c = 1
//3. b * (c + a) = 120
//4. (b * c) + a = 40
//5. b %= a = 5
//6. b %= c = 1



//Question 5.
//
//What are the values of div and div2 below? Are they equal?
//
//let div = 11 / 3
//let div2 = 11.0 / 3.0
//
//div == div2 is false

//
//Question 6.
//
//Given var number = 7.5. What can be inferred about number?
//
//a. number is a float variable
//b. number is a double variable
//c. number is a 32-bit floating point number
//d. not enough information to infer about number's type

//b.


//Question 7.
//
//Without using Playground, will the below code print?
//
//let twelve: Double = 12.0
//let thirteen: Float = 13.0
//
//
//print(twelve + thirteen)
//
//
//no it will not print


Question 8.

Write the following numbers in binary representation:

a. 25 = 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
b. 100 =  0
c. 65
d. 255


Question 8.

Which of the following numbers can't be assigned to an Int8, and why?:

a. 25
b. 100
c. 65
d. 255
