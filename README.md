<<<<<<< HEAD
Friday. We finish by 4:30. :) Monday is a day off. :D

The reading for **Tuesday** is on [Structs and Classes](/lessons/structs-and-classes).

Hello on this fine Wednesday. Today we're diving back into our Monty project. Also, we're gathering corrections
for the Unit 1 assessment scoring. My apologies for the confusion. The schedule is updated with pre-work for
tomorrow. It's the 3rd Stanford video which reviews (really quickly) a bunch of Swift language topics.
