# Access Code 3.2: Mobile Development with iOS

Today we're covering a new view, the [Table View](/lessons/2_2_tableview/). ```UITableView``` is
a very powerful and versatile tool for displaying variable, and potentially large amount
of data. If you're an iOS user you're already familiar with it in its various forms.

Tomorrow is a half day with an assessment. Today, we'll have a dry run of the new mechanism by which
the assessment will be administered.
