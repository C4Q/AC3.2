# Access Code 3.2: Mobile Development with iOS

Great work everybody on the assessment!

Have a great weekend. To cut into that a bit 
I've prepared this [homework](/homework/week-2-playground). I do hope
it's at least a little fun. 

Also don't forget to read up on [functions](/lessons/functions-one), the
subject of Monday's lesson.
