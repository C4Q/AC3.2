Today is Thursday. We're going to mix it up a bit with Liz in the afternoon. Tonight we're going to 
bite the bullet and upgrade to XCode 8 (when we're on real networks). While you're waiting for the
download and install, read this [Swift 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/swift3). Tomorrow we'll 
go through the aftermath together.
