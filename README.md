# Access Code 3.2: Mobile Development with iOS

Happy Wednesday.

Today's lesson is [Conditionals](/lessons/conditionals)

I might have been too quick to dispense with git/github that I forgot to remind you about the reading for tomorrow.
Though, it's always the Resources section of the next day on the schedule.
