# Jargon

- **argument**: An input passed to a function in a call to it, related to parameter. A function can take zero, one or many arguments. Most languages also provide a way to pass a variable number of arguments. 

- **command line interface**: A text based interface to the operating system. Programs or commands are invoked by typing them. There is a long and rich history of using these simple programs and even using them in combination. A rough synonym for console. 

- **console**: A text based interface to the operating system. A rough synonym for command line. 

- **dictionary**: A synonym for an [associative data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array), which maps keys to values.

- **foo**: A common placeholder name used for variables and functions when the actual name isn't important. See [foobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar).

- **high level**: 
    1. An overview with less detail. Ex., "We're going to discuss the requirements on a high level before we get into the implementation."
    1. When used to describe languages and technology it often indicates a simpler means of doing something.

- **holy war**: An unsolvable debate about some aspect of computing that has strong adherents in more than one camp. It's good to recognize when an issue is one of style or choice and when it's being presented otherwise. For example, iOS vs. Android (mobile OSs/phones), Mac vs. PC (computers), spaces vs. tabs (code formatting), vi vs. Emacs (text editors).

- **[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) = Hypertext Transport Protocol**: The TCP-based network protocol used to transmit web pages and other resources over the Internet.

- **lint**: To check for something, for example: comparing your source code against a [style guide](https://github.com/C4Q/AC3.2/tree/master/resources/swift-style-guide)

- **low level**: Using technology that's more basic and "closer to the machine." It's often used to compare programming languages. C is a low level language as compared to JavaScript. This implies it's more challenging to use and more at risk to crash.

- **native**: We distinguish a native app from a web-based solution. Native apps have the potential to perform better with more complicated and sophisticated features and interfaces. The contrast is a cross-platform or web-based app. 

- **function**: A named section of code. It can optionally have parameters, and can declare that when the section of code is finished, it will return a specific type of object. Also can be called a method. Quite similar to a closure. 

- **parameter**: An input to a function, specifically in its definition, related to argument. A function can define zero, one or many parameters. Most languages also provide a way to pass a variable number of arguments.

- **operating system**: A computer needs code to be useful, it needs something that can transform inputs from  keyboard/mice/others into useful actions on a screen. It's the job of the operating system to turn all that raw data into something you can understand. Applications then sit on top of the operating system and provide individual features, like the web browser you're using.
